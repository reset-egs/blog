### *Hello, people of the internet!*

Iâ€™m super excited to welcome you to **ctrl-alt-reset**â€”my little corner of the web.

On the off chance you're not one of my friends Iâ€™ve sent this link to, head over to the [About](https://ctrlaltreset.vercel.app/about "Learn more about me") page to learn more about who I am.

So, whatâ€™s the purpose of this site? I have a vague ideaâ€”but before we get into that, letâ€™s talk about **why** I wanted to create it in the first place.

The main reason is simple: I like making websites.  
Anticlimactic, I knowâ€”but thatâ€™s really all there is to it.

More specifically, I like making *pretty* websites. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s not something I get to do often at my full-time job. I do get to work on a lot of cool stuff (which Iâ€™ll share more about in future posts), but that design itch still needs to be scratched. So I made this site to host my online presenceâ€”at least the parts that are *suitable* for public sharing.

### Why include a blog?

Also simple: I like writing stuff.  
Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always enjoyed.

That said, I wanted to avoid making yet another blog *just* about software development. Medium has that covered. Instead, Iâ€™m leaning toward something more like an online diary.

You might be wondering: _Is this guy going to share what he had for breakfast?_  
Maybeâ€”if it was really good. But more likely, youâ€™ll see content on things I find interesting. And since my interests are pretty broad, that could mean anything from a coding tutorial to a sociological article.

Sure, itâ€™s a strange mix. But honestly, thatâ€™s what excites me. Just imagine a dev stumbling onto a helpful tutorial here, loving it, then clicking around and finding wild, off-topic ramblings. *Thatâ€™s* the vibe Iâ€™m going for.

### Whatâ€™s next?

Iâ€™ve got big plans for this siteâ€”rolled out whenever I find the time.  
One of the first things Iâ€™ll do is move my (currently outdated) portfolio over here.

---

So, what can you expect from this site?  
Only time will tell.

Until then, tune in and *expect the unexpected*.

You know those websites that look like they were made in 1999 â€” but intentionally so? The ones with oversized type, jarring colors, no gradients, no smooth shadows, and *definitely* no soft corners?

### What is Neo-Brutalism?
Neo-brutalism is a web-design trend that deliberately rejects sleek, overly polished aesthetics in favor of something raw and bold. Itâ€™s characterized by harsh contrast, unstyled HTML elements, mono or system fonts, visible borders, and layouts that feel like they werenâ€™t designed--even though they very much were. 

It's not about being uglyâ€”it's actually quite the opposite. Most importantly, it's about being honest, functional and attention-grabbing. Think of it as the digital equivalent of brutalist architecture, but with \`<div>\`s instead of concrete slabs.
### A Brief History
Brutalism started in architecture in the mid-20th century. It was raw, functional, and stripped of decorative fluff. In web design, brutalism first popped up in the early 2010s as a kind of countercultural reaction to overly polished, corporate websites.

Neo-brutalism is a more refined, digital-native version of that idea. It's still anti-fluff, but it often combines the raw aesthetic with intentional structure, UX considerations, and even some subtle elegance.
### Core Principles
Here are a few pillars of neo-brutalist web design:
-   **No gradients. No gloss.** Everything is flat and honest.
    
-   **Visible structure.** Borders, grids, and containers are on full display. Rounded corners are a definite *no-go*.
    
-   **Harsh contrast.** This is often achieved by pure black on white, or clashing neon palettes without any blend or gradient.
    
-   **System fonts.** No Google Fonts bloat â€” just good old \`Arial\`, \`Courier\`, or \`Times\`, although this is not a strong requirement.
    
-   **Minimal interactivity.** Links look like links. Buttons look like buttons. No mystery meat UI with tons of animations.
    
-   **Bold typography.** Big text, raw headings, sometimes with no kerning mercy.
### Why It's Trending
Because design fatigue is real.

After a decade of gradients, neumorphism, smooth animations, and "everything looks the same" websites, neo-brutalism feels refreshing. It's bold. It's weird. It says "a real human made this." 

It also resonates with younger audiences â€” especially designers, devs, and creatives â€” who want to stand out, challenge norms, or just have fun building something that doesn't look like a startup landing page template. And frankly, it's hard not to recognize the appeal of a design trend that *flips the bird* to what is commonly considered appropriate.
### Use Cases & When to Use It
Neo-brutalism isnâ€™t for every project. You probably donâ€™t want your banking app to look like this website.

But it's great for:

-   Personal portfolios
    
-   Art or design blogs
    
-   Fashion showcases
    
-   Landing pages that want to make a strong first impression
    
-   Brands that want to show a bit of edge, attitude, or nostalgia
    
Use it when you want to provoke a reaction â€” not blend in.
### Notable Examples
Some standout examples of neo-brutalism on the web:

-   [WORKWITHUS](https://workwithus.io/) â€” a neo-brutalist take on a job board with a lot of creative positions
    
-   [Demo2023](https://www.demo2023.org/) â€” a promotional website for a design event held in NYC
    
-   [BRUTAL WEB](https://brutalweb.xyz/) â€” a full archive of brutalist and neo-brutalist websites
    
-   [ctrl+alt+reset](https://ctrlaltreset.dev) â€” obviously ðŸ˜‰

These sites often break the rules, yet feel cohesive. Theyâ€™re not broken â€” just brutally intentional.
### My Take on Neo-Brutalism
And now for the part that *surely* everyone has been waiting for â€” my opinion about neo-brutalism.

Personally, I find it very liberating. There's something refreshing about ignoring conventional design "best practices" and leaning into the *rawness* of the web. It reminds me of the early internet â€” the weird, scrappy, personal one.

It also forces you to think differently about design. When you're not relying on animations or gloss, you're left with layout, content, and personality. And sometimes that's more than enough.
